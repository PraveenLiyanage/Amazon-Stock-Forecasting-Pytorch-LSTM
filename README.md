# Amazon Stock Forecasting with PyTorch & LSTM

This project focuses on predicting Amazon stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network implemented with PyTorch. The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques for time series forecasting.

## Overview

The project uses historical stock price data to train an LSTM model, which can then be used to make predictions for future stock prices.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. The project uses the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib torch
```

## Clone this Repo:
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/PraveenLiyanage/Amazon-Stock-Forecasting-Pytorch-LSTM.git
```
